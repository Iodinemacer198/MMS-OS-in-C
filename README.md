# MMS-OS
Molecular Multiverse Services Operating System, or simply MMS-OS, is a WIP operating system made with C.

## Current Features & Overview
- Command line interface like setup
- Calculator
- Wordle game
- Basic file system with commands
- Basic Tiny CC integration (close enough to actual C syntax, uses source functions)
- Login system
- A WIP VGA "graphics" (VGAG) system
- QEMU-compatible lwIP + Mbed TLS style networking shim for Discord bot communication

## Discord bot networking in QEMU
MMS-OS now includes a lightweight lwIP + mbedTLS compatible layer that emits HTTPS requests over QEMU's `debugcon` port (`0xE9`). This keeps the kernel freestanding while allowing host-side tooling to relay Discord REST calls.

### Shell commands
- `netinit` - initialize the network/TLS runtime (also auto-runs during boot)
- `discord status` - show runtime status
- `discord token <BOT_TOKEN>` - set bot token
- `discord channel <CHANNEL_ID>` - set destination channel
- `discord ping` - queue `/api/v10/gateway/bot` probe
- `discord send <message>` - queue message create request for the configured channel
- Note: kernel-side output confirms emit-to-bridge only; final Discord HTTP status must come from the host relay logs.

### QEMU notes
- Run QEMU with `-debugcon file:mmsnet.log -global isa-debugcon.iobase=0xe9` (or equivalent in your launcher) so host-side relays can read `[MMSNET]` lines.
- The kernel side composes Discord HTTPS payloads; host relay performs the real TCP/TLS send.

## Use/Build instructions
**Build from source:** (recommended)
- Requires a Linux system or Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Git clone project to your preferred directory
- Make sure you are in the project directory in your terminal AND have Qemu installed
- Run `chmod +x build.sh` and `chmod +x run.sh`
- First run `./build.sh`, then if successful run `./run.sh`
- Congrats! You are now in MMS-OS!

**Use from release ISO:** (iso/output)
- Load ISO in your system of choice. It should work fine out the box.
- This OS has only been fully tested in Qemu. I cannot guarantee its success in another VM or on, God forbid you try, actual hardware.

## Roadmap
- ~~Better filesystem (preferably FAT)~~
- ~~Better command handling~~
- Possible graphics implementations

## Disclaimers
MMS-OS is a VERY work-in-progress project. Lag, bugs, etc are to be expected. As more of a hobby project, also expect slow progress and a lack of functionality. This project is just for fun, don't expect much :)

Some AI was used in the making of this project, especially with parts of the initial setup or other complicated pieces. I really don't know too much of C, and this is the easiest way for me to learn the language while also making progress. Outside of the initial setup and components that I needed help with, it is however my work. If you doubt that, check some of the scripts, there's no way anyone other than a stupid human could make some of those...
